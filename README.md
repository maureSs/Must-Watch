### Dev notes

Im using React.js for the Front-end / Firebase for the Back-end and MATERIAL-UI/Bootstrap for some features.

The purpose of this application is for you to have an app to take notes of movies and tv shows you want to watch in the future. As you can see in the code, im using the word "show" for both movies and tv shows.
